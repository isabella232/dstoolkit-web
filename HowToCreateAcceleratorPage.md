# Guide on How to Create a New Accelerator Page

## Purpose

- Add a new accelerator page to the toolkit web site. Insure it shows on on the Toolkit page and make sure the contributors are displayed, both on the actual accelerator page and on the contributor's page.
- Show how to set up a local environment, so the page/site can be tested locally. It is important to ensure all looks good and is working before pushing your new branch to GitHub and creating a new Pull Request (to be reviewed and merged into the main branch).
